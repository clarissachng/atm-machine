3. If the PIN is entered incorrectly 3 times the program should output a message to the effect that the card has been retained and should then restart.

If the PIN code is entered correctly the user should be able to
1. Check their balance
2. Withdraw money from their account up to the total of their balance
3. Deposit money into the account

Note: The user’s balance at the beginning of the transaction should be a randomly generated total between £100 - £1000.
